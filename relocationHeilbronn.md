# Relocation to Heilbronn, Germany

Germany is a very unique country, and there is quite a lot to do to relocate to Germany from the countries outside.
Based on my own experience in TUM in early 2024, I'd like to show some guidelines, resources and tips to move to Heilbronn.
Hope that helps, and note that it may be out of date.

### Application for visa
* Get the offer.
* Make an appointment for visa application (very hard in China, do it when you get the oral offer).
* Be careful with your application material especially when applying for research-relevant ones, talk with your supervisor in advance.


### Before departure
Please try to search the web, read tutorials, and talk with your friends in Germany.
* Rent a place that can support anmeldung (registration). Can find a temporary fully-furnished residence first (Most Airbnb/Hotel do not support, Service Apartment may work e.g., Cinari). Ask for the landlord's confirmation in [an official doc](https://www.heilbronn.de/rathaus/buergerservice-a-z/inhalt/wohnungsgeberbestaetigung.html) which is critical to successful registration.
* Make an [online appointment](https://www.heilbronn.de/rathaus/buergerservice-a-z/inhalt/terminreservierung.html) about anmeldung in Rathaus. (Great to be the day immediately after your arrival)
* May need to prepare some law-allowed-amount cash (Germany is not that digitalized and you do not have banking account in the first few days)
* Book air ticket smartly (Great to arrive in Stuggart, but mostly in Frankfurt), and suggest buying the long-distance train ticket in the train station as your flight may be delayed (Buy Deutschland ticket two days before in DB app).
* Learn health insurance in Germany (mostly statutory)
* Do some physical exercise as you may walk a lot for different admin stuff :-)


### Arrive in Germany
Suggest coming to Germany at least **one week** before your starting day to spare your time to focus on the following things.
Register yourself at your appointment time.
Do other stuff in parallel once you get the residence permit:
* Go to the store to get a banking account (e.g., Commerzbank), and a phone number (e.g., Telecom, a prepaid card is fine).
* Get health insurance (may also refund your travel insurance)
* Get taxID (wait for the letter after registration) and pass it to HR.
* Make an appointment to get a settlement permit to extend your stay in Germany. 

### Work-related stuff
* Try to talk with your supervisor or assistant to request a high-performance workstation (maybe with Nvidia RTX-4090 GPU), rather than a laptop much before departure.
* Request campus card to access a list of services in Bildungscampus Heilbronn e.g., your workplace, canteen, library, free shared bike, etc.
* It takes time to get the access to intranet, be patient.

### Tips
* If you do not know German, please install Google Translate on all your device (e.g., extension in Chrome, app in your phone), and it will save your life :-)
* **Fluent** English can help accelerate the whole process, otherwise, remember some essential sentences in German to make your life easier.
* Download Lidl plus and Kaufland app for your cheaper grocery.
