# The guide of paper writing in Latex

This document record my experience in writing a paper with LaTex. So if you'd like to collaborate with me in writing some research papers, please have a look at this guide.

## Overall:
- Use the latex template downloaded from the official sites of the conference or journal.
- Please write each sentence in one row so that readers (actually I) can easily understand.
- Please separate each section as a file, and add them into the main file.
- For each section, figure, table, please attach a label to it with the command `\label{}`. Please name it with semantically e.g., `\label{sec:introduction}`, `\label{fig:comparisonResult}`, `\label{tab:goodExample}`. When referring the `figure/table/section` in the main text, please use `\ref` command e.g., `Fig. \ref{fig: comparisonResult}`. Note that please come up with a **semantic/meaningful** name for the label.
- If multiple users are working on the latex, please make everyone write text in different colors. You can define a macro in the main file like \newcommand{\chunyang}[1]{\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Chunyang}:#1}}. 
- Please put all your references into a file (e.g., called `refercen.bib`), and import it using the latex command. Note that all bibtex can be copied-pasted from Google Scholar.

- Do not add URL in the main text, but put your URL with command `\url{}` in the footnote.
- When the overall draft is done, please try to adjust the figure/table position to make it align with the corresponding text.



## Figures
- When showing results in the figure, please make the font size of the axis labels large enough so that reader can understand it.
- Please store your figure in pdf format as pdf figure is a vector figure. It will not collapse when zooming in.
- Please put all figure files into one folder and refer to it in the latex with relative path, e.g., `\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/autoencoder.pdf}`


## Table
- When using the table to show examples, especially with many rows, please color alternative rows in [white and gray](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5365) with command `\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}` to color every alternate table row. 
- When we want to save space, you can use `\vspace{-2mm}` between the caption and the table, or between the caption and the main text.
- `\setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.7em}` can be used to squeeze the padding space between columns.


## Macro
- When there are multiple collaborators for paper writing, please use the macro command to highlight different color for each user like `\newcommand{\chen}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Chen}: #1}}`.
- If you have a tool to mention within the whole paper, you can give it a name with a macro like `\newcommand{\tool}{{\texttt{TOOL}}\xspace}`.


## Metainfo
Before paper submission (not camera-ready), you may need to remove the meta-info (e.g., copyright) to save space. For example, you can remove the copyright info in ACM template with command lines: 
```
\setcopyright{none}
\settopmatter{printacmref=false} % Removes citation information below abstract
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} % removes footnote with conference information in first column
```
