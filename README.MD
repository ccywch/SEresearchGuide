# Guide for Doing Academic Research in Software Engineering

This is a repository documenting my suggestions about how to do research in software engineering from [my own experience](https://chunyang-chen.github.io).
I may update it from time to time including:
* Tips about [my practice](https://github.com/ccywch/SEresearchGuide/blob/master/PhDsuggestion.md) in being a good SE PhD. 
* Tips about [paper writing](https://github.com/ccywch/SEresearchGuide/blob/master/SEpaperWriting.md) in software engineering.
* Tips about [latex commands](https://github.com/ccywch/SEresearchGuide/blob/master/LatexWriting.md) in writing academic papers.
* Tips about [rebuttal writing](https://github.com/ccywch/SEresearchGuide/blob/master/rebuttalWritting.md) for top conferences in software engineering.
* Tips about [relocation](https://github.com/ccywch/SEresearchGuide/blob/master/relocationHeilbronn.md) to Germany and even specific to Heilbronn.
* Tips about Postdoc/PhD's [thesis mentorship](https://github.com/ccywch/SEresearchGuide/blob/master/ThesisMentorship.md) to Bachelors' and Masters' research projects.

Note that it may be of my bias and may not apply to everyone.
You may take some suggestions according to your own preference and feel free to provide your suggestions.
Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,\
