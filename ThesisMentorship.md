# Bachelor/Master Thesis Mentorship

In most countries, bachelor or master students need to finish a thesis (or final-year project) to be eligible for graduation.
Although the project length may vary (3 months to one year), it is mainly a research project to carry out some academic exploration of a specific topic.
These thesis training not only benefits students, but also mentors in terms of:
  * leadership & team management
  * teaching load counted
  * research progress and implementation
I suggest each Postdoc to mentor 3-5 thesis students, and each PhD to mentor 2-3 thesis students. 

### Tips to mentor thesis students
Please try to be nice and responsible to students.
* Feasible thesis topic:
  * Should not be too difficult or hard for those who are without any prior academic experience.
  * Should be a narrowed/focused/detailed topic without much exploration space which may make junior students lost.
  * Be very clear what students need to do
* Student selection
  * Check their CV and transcript to check their capacity and alignment with your project.
  * Interview them to check their motivation and personality.
  * Ask them to write a detailed research plan based on the literature review on the topic before the formal start/registration.
* Frequent catch-up
  * Weekly meeting with students' **slides** to discuss the progress and plan.
  * Share their progress with the professor from time to time.
  * GitHub Repo or Google Drive to host all relevant code, documentation, etc.
  * Try to teach them to write thesis in [LaTex](LatexWriting.md).


### Specific notes to TUM
* Check detailed information in [CIT official website](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studierende/abschlussarbeit-abschluss/informatik/).
* Come up with your thesis topics and put it into our chair website for promotion.
* Thesis length is 6 months, and unlikely to be extended.
* Thesis mentorship can be counted to teaching load, 1 Master = 0.6 ECTS, 1 Bachelor = 0.2 ECTS, sum cap at 2 ECTS.
* All thesis needs to be registered and graded formally in the central system by the professor.
* Some thesis may be carried out in industry, but mainly determined by their manager in industry. May not be relevant but good opportunity to build industry connections.
* In Germany, course grades range from 1.0 (best) to 5.0 (worst), and students with grade <2.5 can be seen as potential good candidates.
